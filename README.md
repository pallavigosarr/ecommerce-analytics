# ecommerce-analytics
Interactive data analysis and dashboard project exploring 100k+ e-commerce orders. Built with Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

# 📊 Online Shopping Data Analysis Project

## 🎯 Project Overview
This repository contains a data analysis project focused on the public e-commerce dataset. By examining approximately **100,000 successful orders** across 2016–2018, this analysis uncovers key business insights regarding sales growth, category performance, pricing elasticity, and customer retention.

This project was built as a structured data analysis assignment to turn raw relational e-commerce tables into clear, actionable business strategies.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Key Analytics

* **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
* **Core Techniques**: Multi-table relational joins, data cleaning (filtering canceled/unavailable orders), cumulative window aggregation, and statistical correlation tests (Pearson & Spearman coefficients).

## 📈 Key Visual Insights

### 1. Cumulative Revenue Profile (Year-over-Year Growth)
* **Insight**: Sales in 2018 scaled exponentially compared to 2017. By August 2018, total platform sales surpassed **7 Million BRL**, hitting performance milestones months ahead of the previous year's schedule. 
* **Business Action**: Infrastructure, server capacities, and seller onboarding programs must scale up dynamically in the first half of the year to match compounding transaction velocities.

### 2. Category Performance (Market Share Concentration)
* **Insight**: **Health & Beauty** is the absolute #1 category on the platform, accounting for **9.4% of all revenue generated**. The top 10 categories alone generate more than **63%** of overall marketplace sales.
* **Business Action**: Allocate premium promotional banners and marketing budgets directly to *Health & Beauty* and *Watches & Presents*, as these categories enjoy guaranteed customer traction and high margins.

### 3. Price vs. Sales Volume (The Price Elasticity Myth)
* **Insight**: Statistical tests yield a correlation score near zero (Pearson: `-0.033`, Spearman: `-0.064`). Lowering an item's price does **not** trigger an organic increase in transaction volume.
* **Business Action**: Sellers should avoid margin-destroying price wars. Instead, keep prices fair and compete on non-price conversion variables like high review scores and fast shipping.

### 4. 6-Month Customer Retention Rate (The Loyalty Gap)
* **Insight**: Company faces an extreme loyalty bottleneck: **98.38%** of shoppers are "One-and-Done" buyers. Only **1.62%** return for a second purchase within 6 months.
* **Insight Context**: Because company operates as a silent backend aggregator on major department store websites, consumers never realize they are buying through whch seller, which limits organic brand stickiness.
* **Business Action**: To fix this "leaky bucket," introduce automated email retargeting or insert physical discount flyers directly inside shipping boxes to encourage repeat sales.
